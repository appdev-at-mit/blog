hello world!

As this is the first post, a little explanation about what the blog is in order. \
Typically, a group blog for a research group
is somewhat like a lab journal; usually, it will contain results of recent experiments, interesting
findings, or other developments. It's semi-formal, so there's no need to format everything
perfectly or use pretty language everywhere. In this case, the blog is also public, acting as a way
to indicate to others that yes, we exist, and we are doing things! 

The end goal is that the blog will slowly build up a knowledge bank about development,
similar to those posts on Medium (or occasionally, a really good answer on StackOverflow). 
Over semesters, everyone's collective expertise will help each other write better code 
and write it more efficiently. One use case would be just
explaining a code snippet that does something useful in a certain framework, for example. 

Any member of the club is welcome and encouraged to contribute, either by way of writing posts
or editing others for clarity and accuracy.
